App::PDBRun version 0.00_01
===========================

Utility allowing use of PDB IDs as command-line arguments

INSTALLATION

To install this module, open a terminal in the directory containing the
unarchived source and type:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This should work on most modern systems assuming you have Perl and a Make
utility installed and configured in the usual way.  The most likely change
you might need to make to the above is replacing the first line with

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

if you're on a Unix-like OS and wish to install the module in your home
directory.

The `make test' step is optional but recommended to verify that the code
works as expected on your system before proceeding with the install.
