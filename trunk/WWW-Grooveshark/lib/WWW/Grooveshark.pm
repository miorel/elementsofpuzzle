=head1 DESCRIPTION

Grooveshark is an internationally-available online music search, streaming,
and recommendation service.  C<WWW::Grooveshark> wraps this service's API in
an object-oriented Perl interface, allowing you to programmatically search
for songs, artists, albums, or playlists; browse popular music; get song
recommendations; manage playlists; and more.

=head1 API KEYS

...are needed to use the Grooveshark API.  E-mail
E<lt>developers@grooveshark.comE<gt> to get one.  They'll probably also link
you to the official API page, which seems to still be in beta.

=cut

use Digest::MD5 qw(md5_hex);
use JSON::Any;
use URI::Escape;
use XML::RSS::Parser;

use WWW::Grooveshark::Response qw(:fault);

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

To use this module, you'll have to create a C<WWW::Grooveshark> instance.  The
default, argumentless constructor should be adequate, but customization is
possible through key-value options.

=over 4

=item WWW::Grooveshark->new( %OPTIONS )

Prepares a new C<WWW::Grooveshark> object with the specified options, which are
passed in as key-value pairs, as in a hash.  Accepted options are:

=over 4

=item I<https>

Whether or not to use HTTPS for API calls.  Defaults to false, i.e. just use
HTTP.

=item I<service>

The hostname to use for the Grooveshark API service.  Defaults to
"api.grooveshark.com" unless C<staging> is true, in which case it defaults to
"staging.api.grooveshark.com".

=item I<staging>

Governs the default hostname for the C<service>.  Has no effect if a C<service>
is explicity specified.

=item I<path>

Path (relative to the hostname) to request for API calls.  Defaults to "ws".

=item I<api_version>

Version of the Grooveshark API you plan on using.  Defaults to 1.0.

=item I<query_string>

The query string to include in API call requests.  May be blank.  Defaults to
"json" so that the full default API root URL becomes
E<lt>http://api.grooveshark.com/ws/1.0/?jsonE<gt>.

=item I<agent>

Value to use for the C<User-Agent> HTTP header.  Defaults to
"WWW::Grooveshark/### libwww-perl/###", where the "###" are substituted with
the appropriate versions.  This is provided for convenience: the user-agent
string can also be set in the C<useragent_args> (see below).  If it's set in
both places, this one takes precedence.

=item I<useragent_class>

Name of the L<LWP::UserAgent> compatible class to be used internally by the 
newly-created object.  Defaults to L<LWP::UserAgent>.

=item I<useragent_args>

Hashref of arguments to pass to the constructor of the aforementioned
C<useragent_class>.  Defaults to no arguments.

=back

Options not listed above are ignored.

=cut

sub new {
	my($pkg, %opts) = @_;

	# user-agent constructor args
	my $ua_args = $opts{useragent_args} || {};
	
	# user-agent string
	$ua_args->{agent} = $opts{agent} if defined $opts{agent};
	$ua_args->{agent} ||= __PACKAGE__  . "/$VERSION ";

	# prepare user-agent object

=head1 DESTRUCTOR

I like code that cleans up after itself.  If a program starts by creating a
session, it's only logical that it should finish by ending it.  But should it
be up to the programmer to manage when that happens?  Anyone can be forgetful.

Enter the destructor.  Continue explicitly cleaning up, but if you forget to
do so, the destructor has your back.  When a C<WWW::Grooveshark> object gets
garbage collected, it will destroy its session if any.

=cut

sub DESTROY {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->session_destroy if $self->sessionID;	
}

=head1 MANAGEMENT METHODS

The following methods do not issue any API calls but deal with management of
the C<WWW::Grooveshark> object itself.  Ideally, you won't have to touch these
methods too often.  If you find yourself being insufficiently lazy, let me
know how I can make this module smarter.

=over 4

=item $gs->sessionID( )

Returns the Grooveshark API session ID, or C<undef> if there is no active
session.

=cut

sub sessionID {
	return shift->{_session_id};
}

=item $gs->userID( )

=back

=cut

sub userID {
	return shift->{_user_id};
}

=head1 API METHODS

The methods listed here directly wrap the methods of Groveshark's JSON-RPC
API.  As you may have noticed, there is a very complex mapping between the
API's official methods and those of this interface: replace the period ('.')
with an underscore ('_').  As with the constructor, pass arguments as
hash-like key-value pairs, so for example, to get the 11th through 20th most
popular songs, I would:

  my $response = $gs->popular_getSongs(limit => 10, page => 2);

All API methods return L<WWW::Grooveshark::Response> objects, even in case of
errors, but their boolean evaluation is L<overload>ed to give false for fault
responses.  Make a habit of checking that method calls were successful:

  die $response->fault_line unless $response;

Access result elements by using the key as the method name.  In list context,
dereferencing takes place automagically, saving you a few characters:

  my @songs = $response->songs;

But after this first "layer" you're stuck dealing with hashrefs, as in the
L</SYNOPSIS> (though perhaps this will change in the future if I'm up to it):

  for(@songs) {
      printf("%s", $_->{songName});
      printf(" by %s", $_->{artistName});
      printf(" on %s\n", $_->{albumName});
      printf(" <%s>\n", $_->{liteUrl});
  }

Check the official API documentation for valid keys. Alternatively, experiment!

  use Data::Dumper;
  print Dumper($response);

This module's interface aims to parallel the official API as much as possible.
Consequently, all methods take argument names identical to the official ones.
However, some methods are "overloaded."  For example,
C<session_createUserAuthToken> gives you the option of passing a plaintext
C<pass> rather than a C<hashpass>, handling C<hashpass> generation for you.

Some methods may also have side effects.  These are generally "harmless": for
example, successful C<session_create> and C<session_get> calls store the
returned session ID so that it can be passed in the header of subsequent API
calls.

Alternate method arguments and any side effects are listed where applicable.

=item $gs->session_createUserAuthToken( username => $USERNAME , pass => $PASS )

=item $gs->session_createUserAuthToken( username => $USERNAME , hashpass => $HASHPASS )

Creates an authentication token for the specified $USERNAME.  Authentication
requires a $HASHPASS, which is a hexadecimal MD5 hash of the concatenation of
$USERNAME and a hexadecimal MD5 hash of $PASS.  If you're storing the password 
as plaintext, don't bother generating the $HASHPASS yourself: just omit the
$HASHPASS and give C<pass =E<gt> $PASS> to this method.  If you specify both a
$HASHPASS and a $PASS, the $HASHPASS will take precedence (but don't try it).
Regardless, the $PASS will be removed from the arguments that are passed during
the API call.

Gets the session ID of the currently active session.  Presumably this updates
every once in a while because there wouldn't be much use in this method
otherwise: an active session is required to call it, and returning the same
session ID would be a waste of an API call...  Assuming this does update,
calling this method has the side effect of updating the session ID of this

=item $gs->song_getStreamUrl( songID => $SONG_ID )

Gets an URL for streaming playback of the song with the specified $SONG_ID.
According to the response header, this method is deprecated and 
C<song_getStreamUrlEx> should be used instead.

sub song_getStreamUrl {

}

=item $gs->song_getStreamUrlEx( songID => $SONG_ID [, lowBitrate => $LOW_BITRATE ] )

The supposedly preferred alternative to C<song_getStreamUrlEx>.  Use at your
own risk: the existence of this method was not mentioned in the official API
documentation at the time of this writing; it was discovered through the
sandbox tool as well as the deprecation message in the header of
C<song_getStreamUrl> responses.

=item $gs->song_getWidgetEmbedCode( songID => $SONG_ID [, theme => $THEME ] [, pxHeight => $HEIGHT ] [, pxWidth => $WIDTH ] [, ap => $AP ] )

Gets HTML code for embedding the song with the specified $SONG_ID.  The code
may be customized by specifying a pixel $HEIGHT and $WIDTH as well as a theme
for the widget, which must be in C<qw(metal grass wood water)>.  The $AP is
optional and appears only in the sandbox tool and not the official
documentation: its meaning is unknown.

=cut

sub song_getWidgetEmbedCode {
	my($self, %args) = @_;
	my $ret = $self->_call('song.getWidgetEmbedCode', %args);
	return $ret;
}

=item $gs->song_getWidgetEmbedCodeFbml( songID => $SONG_ID [, theme => $THEME ] [, pxHeight => $HEIGHT ] [, pxWidth => $WIDTH ] [, ap => $AP ]

This is in fact not an API method but a wrapper for C<song_getWidgetEmbedCode>
that modifies the returned HTML code to FBML so it can be used in Facebook
applications.  This method is experimental: use it at your own risk.

=cut

sub song_getWidgetEmbedCodeFbml {
	my $ret = shift->song_getWidgetEmbedCode(@_);

}

=item $gs->song_unfavorite( songID => $SONG_ID )

Removes the song with the specified $SONG_ID from the logged-in user's list
of favorites.

	my $ret = $self->_call('song.unfavorite', %args);

=head2 TINYSONG

=over 4

=item $gs->tinysong_create( songID => $SONG_ID )

=item $gs->tinysong_create( query => $QUERY [, useFirstResult => $USE_FIRST_RESULT ] )

Creates a tiny URL that links to the song with the specified $SONG_ID.  The
method seems to also allow searching (if a $QUERY and whether to
$USE_FIRST_RESULT are specified), but this form appears to be buggy at the
time of this writing, and is discouraged.

=cut

sub tinysong_create {
	my($self, %args) = @_;
