WWW::PDB version 0.00_03
========================

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established in 1971 as a repository of the
atomic coordinates of protein structures (Bernstein et al., 1997), but it
has since outgrown that role, proving invaluable not only to the research
community but also to students and educators (Berman et al., 2002).

This module is an object-oriented Perl interface to the Protein Data Bank.
It provides methods for retrieving files (optionally caching them locally) and
also wraps the SOAP functionality of the PDB's web services.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, open a terminal in the directory containing the
unarchived source and type:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This should work on most modern systems assuming you have Perl and a Make
utility installed and configured in the usual way.  The most likely change
you might need to make to the above is replacing the first line with

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

if you're on a Unix-like OS and wish to install the module in your home
directory.

The `make test' step is optional but recommended to verify that the code
works as expected on your system before proceeding with the install.

DEPENDENCIES

This distribution requires the following other packages:

  Carp
  Exporter
  Fcntl
  File::Path
  File::Spec
  IO::File
  IO::Uncompress::Gunzip
  Net::FTP
  SOAP::Lite
