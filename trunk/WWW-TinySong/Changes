----------------

January 17, 2009
----------------
 * updated documentation
 * testing for unexpected results was broken through no fault of this
   module: I guess the Grooveshark/TinySong team wanted to minimize
   rickrolling because there's no more Rick Astley in the top ten
   search results for "Never Gonna Give You Up"; changed tests to use
   "We Are The Champions" instead, does anyone besides Queen have such
   a song?
